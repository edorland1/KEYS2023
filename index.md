## About

Ellie Dorland is a rising senior at City Highschool in Tucson, Arizona. During the summer of 2023 she is an intern at The University of Arizona through the BIO5 Institute's KEYS program.

This summer she is an intern working at The University of Arizona in Dr. Tyson L. Swetnam's lab: a member of [CyVerse](https://cyverse.org), a cutting edge cyberinfrastructure funded by the National Science Foundation that is designed for research and committed to the principles of open science. 
 
This website follows the [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care) data principles and hopes to help further open science. 


### KEYS 2023 Main Project

The KEYS 2023 Main Project is the culmination of the program, where I applied the skills and knowledge I learned to a real-world problem. My project focused on the applications of AI in data analysis, specifically related to epidemics. Through my project, I was able to use AI such as Chat-GPT to help me write code and create multiple heatmaps of varying epidemics. This project not only created a more efficient way of mapping datasets geographically but it also introduced the use of AI as a tool in data analysis. This is important because it helps to make data science more effective and accessible
### Results

The results of my project are presented in a poster that summarizes my research question, methods, findings, and conclusions. You can view the poster {here}(poster.md).

### Chat GPT

ChatGPT is an AI language model by OpenAI that generates human-like responses to text prompts, enabling interactive conversations and assisting with various tasks, from creative writing to code creation. For my project I used Chat GPT to help me write code and evaluate data faster.
